# NexusPlay – ALX Project Nexus Capstone

## Overview
NexusPlay is my ALX Project Nexus capstone — a dynamic, responsive e-commerce platform for discovering and purchasing video games across PC, console, and mobile.

The project is inspired by my lifelong passion for gaming, with its layout influenced by platforms like Steam and Xbox. Over the years, I’ve explored countless titles on PC and mobile, and NexusPlay reflects my dream of building a dedicated, beautifully designed platform for gamers.

This repository documents:

- My learning journey through the ALX ProDev Frontend Engineering program.
- The design and development process of NexusPlay from concept to deployment.

## Project Goals
- Build a production-grade web application using modern frontend technologies.
- Create a visually appealing, responsive UI inspired by platforms like Steam, Xbox Store, and Epic Games Store.
- Deliver smooth browsing, searching, and wishlist/cart functionality.

Key learnings include:

- Component-driven architecture (React, React Native).
