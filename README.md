# ALX Project Nexus – Frontend Engineering Journey & Capstone

Welcome to my **ALX ProDev Frontend Engineering** documentation hub.

This repository (`alx-project-nexus`) serves two purposes:

- Reflect on the major concepts and tools I’ve learned throughout the program.
- Document the ongoing development of my capstone project — **NexusPlay**, a dynamic video game e-commerce platform.

## About the ALX ProDev Frontend Engineering Program

The ALX ProDev Frontend Program is a hands-on, industry-focused curriculum that equips learners with practical skills to build production-grade frontend applications.

Over the span of the program, I’ve worked with cutting-edge tools, tackled real-world problems, and collaborated with backend developers to simulate an actual developer environment.
